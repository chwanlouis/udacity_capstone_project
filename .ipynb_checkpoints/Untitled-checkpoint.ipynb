    "\n",
    "Algorithmic trading begins in the early 1970s introduced by New York Stock exchange. Many traders and engineers develop technical indicators to identify the market status. After 10 years, algorithmic trading became widely used in trading S&P 500 equity and futures markets. As the development of electronic communication networks goes on and the US decreased the minimum tick size, Algo-trading was strongly encouraged. Till 2001, the concept of machine learning based trading agent is built by a team of IBM. [#1] IBM owns MGD and Hewlett-Packard owns ZIP. Both of the agents out-perform human traders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The financial market is dynamic and full of uncertainty. Lots of financial industry like hedge funds have to works well with data, like time series data like the price of stocks and futures and multidimensional data like fundamental factors of a company. Investment bank hires many financial experts to building strategies for trading but people work emotionally. Algorithmic trading can help the expert to do judgment but the signals and indicators are all defined by a human. Algo-trading just provides a systematic way to trade according to a human logic. Can we build a reinforcement agent that can recognize signal by itself? This is the propose of this project."

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Over hundreds of technical and statistical indicators are used for machine learning based trading agent. After training, the agent can turn the indicators into trading decisions(buy or sell with different amount). The agent at first will take data and theirs TAs as input. Then calculate the 'score' of each fund. It is considered as a classification problem. In the second part, we may directly correct the score to the nearest integer percentage(MPF must have an integer percentage i.e. the smallest unit is 1%) and assign it to the portfolio weight."

Secondly, Sun Life MPF service charge is counted and reflected inside the product itself with little entry barrier. Usually, the bond trading is requiring 1.5M cash in security account which is not feasible for the majority of people. The twelve funds are provided by Sun Life MPF."
